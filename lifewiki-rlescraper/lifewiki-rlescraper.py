# lifewiki-rlescraper-v1.0.py
# Version 0.6 of this script was used to generate and upload 387 missing RLE files on 
#    http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki,
# that were present in the RLE namespace under RLE:{pname} or RLE:{pname}_synth
# but not in the actual LifeWiki pattern collection as of 1/26/2019 --
#    http://www. conwaylife.com/patterns/all.zip
# Version 0.7 also creates .cells files associated with RLE already uploaded
#    to the LifeWiki server, if the pattern in question is less than 65 cells
#    wide and less than 101 cells high (roughly matching Life Lexicon limits),
#    and if no {pname}.cells file has already been uploaded to the server.
#    On 6 February 2019, 695 .cells files created in this way were bulk-uploaded.
# Version 0.8 also checks for capital letters in pnames, and complains if found.
#    Also added a "noRLEheader" list for patterns where pattern size can't be
#    determined from the header line of the raw RLE file.
# Version 0.9 checks that every infobox pname has "rle = true" and "plaintext = true"
#    (embedded viewers automatically add RLE and plaintext links via template change)
# Version 1.0 does a better job of checking that articles reported to be missing
#     "rle = true" parameters actually contain an infobox
#
# Pretty much the only good thing about this code is that it works, and saves
#   a considerable amount of admin time creating and uploading files one by one.
#
# DONE:  add a check for {pname}_synth.rle,
#        and create file for upload if not found in pattern collection
# DONE:  using the above check of downloaded RLE files, create
#        .cells versions of every 64x64 or smaller RLE on the LifeWiki
#        Have to process the returned web page data (not just check for Not Found),
#        remove any comments, find the header line, load the file into Golly,
#        check the pattern's bounding box, and export modified comments
#        and the correct ASCII pattern if everything seems to be in order.
# TODO:  check the contents of {pname}.rle, {pname}_synth.rle, and {pname}.cells,
#        and report all cases of discrepancies.  The human running the 
#        script should ideally resolve all these differences, either by
#        reverting changes on the LifeWiki or by submitting the new
#        version of the RLE (from the RLE: namespace) for upload.
# TODO:  find a way to mark embedded viewers with oversized RLE patterns,
#        so that the plaintext link doesn't show up -- or redirect that link
# TODO:  track down bug where a trailing comment after the RLE keeps the
#        .cells pattern from being created (unless it's the lack of #N?)
